# InterSpace

InterSpace (short for Interaction Space), uses the quantifiable elements of speech to generate flexible, procedural shapes or blobs. This generation of blobs needs no more than a small set of parameters to dynamically spawn and encode the rich details of an interaction. Since visualising the interaction requires mapping the abstract onto the physical, three-dimensional shapes provide both the required level of abstraction as well as the level of complexity sufficient to dynamically encode a progressive set of non-spatial elements (such as paralanguage, turn design or social structure on different layers of interaction).  

Following existing research on language, this method first breaks down Human-AI interactions into components, starting from one turn as a unit of analysis and then gradually constructing an artificial landscape that encrypts further layers of social complexity. In the process of selecting which data to visualise, multiple criteria were considered, but the outcome was more so dictated by the aim of the project. As such, focusing on patterns of response and participation, fluctuating moods and overall synchronisation proved the more revealing method of materialising the ebbs and flows of a conversation. These were also hypothesised to highlight the potential incongruities or dissonances that arise on the background of an emerging social structure.
